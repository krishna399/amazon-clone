# About

This is an application that intends to be a clone for a simple e-commerce site inspired by amazon. I have created this to improve my overall skills. I have used the following:
- firebase for hosting, and storing data
- Stripe for payment
- Maetrial Ui for components
- react hooks for storing state as its a small prototype

### Install
Clone or download the copy of project. Move to the root directory of the project and run `npm install`.


### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.


The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### Deploy

- To deploy you first need to create firebase account, then create project in firebase and copy the new config properties and paste them in `firebase.js` .
- Once done, login to firebase via cmd using `firebase login`.
-  Now run `firebase init`.
-  Run `npm run build`.
-  Now run `firebase deploy`.
